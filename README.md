# Learning in Public – Tech Blogs

Hi 👋  
I’m a beginner transitioning into tech and learning computer science fundamentals.

I write blogs to:
- Solidify my understanding
- Practice explaining technical concepts
- Improve through feedback

## Blogs

2. **Git Internals: Beyond the Commands**

## Feedback Request 🙏

If you’re experienced:
- Please point out mistakes
- Suggest better explanations
- Tell me where you felt confused

You can:
- Open an **Issue**
- Or comment on the original blog

Thank you for helping a learner grow 🌱
